[localhost](http://localhost)
=========

My **own example server** runs on *Windows 8.1* under *Apache HTTPD v2.4* include *PHP 5.6.11* (*Win32*).

## Disk Drive
  > I run under `C:\` drive!

## Requirement
* Windows 8.1
* [Apache HTTPD v2.4](http://www.apachelounge.com/download/) or higher ([My Download version](http://www.apachelounge.com/download/VC14/binaries/httpd-2.4.16-win32-VC14.zip))
* [PHP v5.6.11](http://windows.php.net/download/) or higher ([My Download version](http://windows.php.net/downloads/releases/php-5.6.11-Win32-VC11-x86.zip))


## Installation
* Install the Apache HTTPD Server
* And then the PHP package

I put that all into `C:\Server\`.

## Screenshot
So it looked when Apache HTTPD Server was finished under [http://localhost](http://localhost):

So it looked when PHP is activated (phpinfo.php):
